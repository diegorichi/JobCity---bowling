## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a Project that runs from command line and return the sheet with the game result.

## Notes

If you are runnning this into a windows system, you need to use mvnw instead mvn command line

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To get the project you can clone from my repository on github:

```
https://github.com/diegorichi/bowling.git
```
Also you can use the zip i've sended by email.

### Prerequisites

You need to install  the following.

```
https://www.oracle.com/ar/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html
https://git-scm.com/downloads
https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
```
Also you can install the optional software to package and extend the application. <br>
An IDE:
```
https://spring.io/tools
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

```
If you want to use a docker image
```
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
```
##  Installing <a name = "installing"></a>

After install the required software, you can build, compile and run the project.<br>

To clean and build the package
```
mvn clean package
```
and then you can see the message at the end: <br/>
```
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

If you want to build the docker image:

```
docker build -t richi/bowling-spring-boot-docker .
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

If you want to run only the test cases, just run into the root folder this simple command.

```
mvn test
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

There are three ways to use this application.<br/>

With pure java command line:
```
java -jar target\bowling-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=dev --data=.\gamedata.txt
```
With maven running the spring-boot application:
```
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments=--data=.\gamedata.txt -P dev
```
of course you can use prod as -P (Profile) parameter<br/>

With docker if you have builded the image
```
docker run -v /home/diego/projects/bowling:/tmp/ richidiego/richi:bowling-spring-boot-docker --data=/tmp/gamedata.txt
```
I want to explain this command line of docker:<br/>
-v is used to link a local folder with a folder inside the container creating a volume. In this way you can point the local folder to the folder containing the files with the data that you want to test.<br/>
Then you need to add the name of the image builded in [installing](#installing)<br/>

--data is user to refer to the game data file that you have in your local folder (remember that you've linked containing folder with -v parameter)

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Also to push or pull into your docker repository:
docker push richidiego/richi:bowling-spring-boot-docker
docker pull richidiego/richi:bowling-spring-boot-docker

where richidiego/richi is the your own repository imagen name
